# 589-ML-Regression
Train and evaluate different regression models on two datasets, based on Python 3.6 via Anaconda.

The regression task consists on finding a model that, for every input, outputs a value. 
While for classification tasks this output is one of several possible classes, for regression problems it is a real number.

- Decision trees

- Cross-validation

- Nearest neighbors

- Linear model
